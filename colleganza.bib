	abstract={The Venetians had a substantial stake in the local trade of the Byzantine empire and provided essential naval assistance. The chrysobull of 992 was a confirmation of existing privileges and practices. The same was true of the chrysobull traditionally dated to 1082, which Alexius I Komnenos granted to the Venetians. His son and successor John II refused to ratify the chrysobull while Manuel I Komnenos also sought to bring the Venetians to heel and adopted a bolder strategy. He challenged their control of the Adriatic and in 1171 interned Venetians resident in the empire and seized their property. The Venetians survived only because they had the Adriatic to fall back on. Venice derived its basic strengths from the resources of the northern Adriatic, which allowed them to equip formidable fleets which, in turn, helped them to dominate the Adriatic and to further their interests in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean. Despite the frictions, the Venetian patriciate understood that their interests were best served by effective Byzantine government, which guaranteed the security of the seas.}

It examines the ways by which Venice acquired empire: conquest, purchase, settlement. Not interested in territory per se, Venice wanted trading posts and water refueling stations for its ships. It explores the huge expansion of Venetian trade and trade routes, including into the Black Sea, and the trade routes to India and China, the latter pioneered by Marco Polo. It also shows how urban infrastructure projects, especially the creation of fondachi (hospice/warehouses) for foreign merchants, the Arsenal, and the Mint, supported Venetian trade. The chapter considers how Venice used both hard and soft power to assert its trade monopoly over the Adriatic and its growing trade and military rivalry with Genoa.}",

  abstract={This paper examines the transformation of Venetian commerce across the twelfth century, arguing that the strategies of Venetian merchants are best described using two distinct models. One was locally integrated and geographically decentralized, typical of merchants who settled abroad and became part of local societies, sometimes retaining few clear links to Venice. The other was far more centralized, characterized by short-term, profit-focused ventures originating in Venice that precluded deep entanglements in foreign economies. Both models were facilitated by the unstructured nature of Venetian overseas administration, which accommodated a degree of autonomy for expatriates while providing the infrastructure necessary for transient commerce. The decline of the integrated model began with the imperial sanctions of 1171 and culminated with the Fourth Crusade (1202Ð1204), after which the centralized model came to dominate. The subsequent importance of the Òsedentary merchantÓ in Venetian trade was shaped as much by political as by economic factors.}

abstract="The importance of institutions and their relationship with macroeconomic variables has attracted the attention of many researchers. The existing literature indicates a significant relationship between institutions and the economic environment, which is strengthened by trade openness. Also, the economic literature shows that the phenomenon of inertia is ambiguous and like a double-edged sword. It also seems that the existence of inertia, especially for developing countries, leads to suboptimal macroeconomic and foreign trade performance. By understanding these conditions, this chapter examines the relationship between foreign trade and institutional inertia. To answer this question while reviewing the literature, a simple theoretical model based on Gartner (Macroeconomics under flexible exchange rates. Harvester Wheatsheaf, New York, 1993) has been used. The findings show that there is a significant relationship between foreign trade and institutional inertia. Accordingly, although institutional change and foreign trade can move independently of each other, if they move together and this issue is addressed by policymakers, it can lead to a stronger relationship between institutions and economic performance.",

    abstract = "{International trade can have profound effects on domestic institutions. We examine this proposition in the context of medieval Venice circa 800–1600. Early on, the growth of long-distance trade enriched a broad group of merchants who used their newfound economic muscle to push for constraints on the executive, that is, for the end of a de facto hereditary Doge in 1032 and the establishment of a parliament in 1172. The merchants also pushed for remarkably modern innovations in contracting institutions that facilitated long-distance trade, for example, the colleganza. However, starting in 1297, a small group of particularly wealthy merchants blocked political and economic competition: they made parliamentary participation hereditary and erected barriers to participation in the most lucrative aspects of long-distance trade. Over the next two centuries this led to a fundamental societal shift away from political openness, economic competition, and social mobility and toward political closure, extreme inequality, and social stratification. We document this oligarchization using a unique database on the names of 8,178 parliamentarians and their families’ use of the colleganza in the periods immediately before and after 1297. We then link these families to 6,959 marriages during 1400–1599 to document the use of marriage alliances to monopolize the galley trade. Monopolization led to the rise of extreme inequality, with those who were powerful before 1297 emerging as the undisputed winners.}",

  	abstract={Around the turn of the fourteenth century many of the communes of north and central Italy reached political and constitutional settlements after decades of conflict between the old nobility, new merchants, and artisans. In 1293, for example, Florence passed the Ordi- nances of Justice, establishing the city?s guild-based republican regime. Other cities, such as Padua and Ferrara, opted for princely rule. Venice too saw the conclusion of decades of social and political unrest. According to the traditional interpretation, the Venetian crisis was resolved with the passage in 1297 of a law known as the Serrata, or Closing, of the Great Council, a constitutional act that firmly established the city?s republican regime on the basis of family membership and hereditary right and in so doing defined the ruling class of nobles. The Serrata has assumed a central place in Venetian historiography, and some of the most eminent scholars of the Venetian Middle Ages, including Roberto Cessi, Frederic Lane, and Giorgio Cracco, have debated its significance. In this essay, which draws on his important 1989 study Der venezianische Adel bis zur Schlieﬂung des Groﬂen Rats, Gerhard Rˆsch tests the findings of these earlier historians and concludes that the Serrata was in actuality an extended process of social, legal, and political adjustment lasting more than three decades. Although the Serrata no longer stands as a discrete historical event, scholars nonetheless continue to explore the e?ect it had on the way Venetians thought about themselves, about their history, and, in particular, about questions of social privilege down to the end of the Republic.}
