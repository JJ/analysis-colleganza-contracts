However, this claim is mainly based on anecdotal evidence and limited case studies. In this paper, by relying on an original database of biographical and relational information on over 4,600 members, we carry out the first large-scale exploratory analysis of the network of interfamily marriages in ’Ndrangheta. Our analysis shows that this alliance network is polycentric, made up of cohesive subgroups centered around well-connected, powerful families, that occupy different positions in the network. The presence of patterns suggests that marriages in ’Ndrangheta are possibly the result of family strategies to explore and exploit their power and business. We discuss the implications of these findings for the study of marriages as an organizational instrument.}

The closure argument is that social capital is created by a network of strongly interconnected elements. The structural hole argument is that social capital is created by a network in which people can broker connections between otherwise disconnected segments. I draw from a comprehensive review elsewhere (Burt 2000) to support two points in this chapter: there is replicated empirical evidence on the social capital of structural holes, and the contradiction between network closure and structural holes can be resolved in a more general network model of social capital. Brokerage across structural holes is the source of value added, but closure can be critical to realizing the value buried in structural holes.}

Consistent with our theory of political intermediation, we present evidence that family network centrality facilitates relationships of political exchange. Moreover, we show that family networks exercise an effect independent of wealth, historical elite status, or previous electoral success.}

  abstract={Analysis of social networks is suggested as a tool for linking micro and macro levels of sociological theory. The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.}

  abstract={Previous studies which examine the theory linking social resources to instrumental action have focused on a particular activated set of social ties in order to assess the effects of social resources on a specific action (finding a job or finding a stranger). However, the theory also implies that an individual's access to such social resources is contingent upon his/her social position as well as the nature of the social ties used. Assuming positions in the occupational structure represent resources, this paper reports a study designed to examine access to occupations through social ties.
Data tend to support two major propositions in the theory. The strength of positions (as indicated by father's occupation) as well as the strength of ties (as indicated by the nature of the tie being a relative, friend or acquaintance) affect one's access to high-prestige occupations and affect the range of occupations accessed. Higher original positions and weaker ties (friends and acquaintances rather than relatives) provide better access to white-collar or more prestigious occupations, and, as a consequence, provide access to a wider range of occupations. Weaker ties provide better access to social resources than stronger ties, especially for those whose original positions are relatively low. There is also some evidence that friends, as opposed to relatives and acquaintances, may provide the widest access to different positions in the occupational structure. However, this finding is tentative since access through acquaintances may have been underestimated due to the particular measure used and to the possibility of a recall problem.}

  abstract={For at least the last three decades, social capital and social networks studies have made major contributions to theory and research in sociology and the social sciences. While these two lines of research tend to cover similar groundÐie, interpersonal resources and relationshipsÐthe lack of overlap between scholars and scholarship that focuses on social capital and social networks is surprising. Generally speaking, social capital researchers tend to operate in primarily substantive terrains and deploy a variety of methodological tools to address how social resources are pooled and affect life circumstances. Social network scholars tend to be more tightly knit around quantitative tools that help them to analyze and visualize network structures. It might be said that one can either be a social capital scholar or a social networks scholar, but rarely both at the same time.
While this is admittedly an oversimplification, evidence on publication patterns supports our general intuition of the divide between social capital and social networks research. Based on a keyword search using Sociological Abstracts, Figure 3.1 shows growth in social capital and social network research into the initial decade of the twenty-first century. 2 While social network scholarship continued to increase in the 2010s, social capital research has appeared to plateau. Combined research on social capital and social networksÐie, studies that include both keywordsÐhas remained minimal throughout the last two decades. We are not the first to point out the segmentation of social capital and social networks research. In the late 2000s, sociologists Jim Moody and Pam Paxton co-organized a conference that sought to bring together social capital and social networks researchers to seek common ground in their research perspectives and endeavors. In their introduction to the subsequent two-volume series in the American Behavioral Scientist (Moody & Paxton, 2009), they sought to (a) summarize the distinctiveness and overlap between the two literatures and (b) offer suggestions as to how the two approaches might bridge the divide. Specifically, they argued that social capital research emphasizes the content of social relations rather than the structure of social relations. Social network research pursues the opposite strategy. They argued that researchers should build bridges between social capital and social network terrains by borrowing the emphases found in the opposite camp. That is to say, social network scholars should focus more on content and social capital scholars should focus more on structure. The Òcontent-structureÓ distinction is indeed a useful conceptual tool for considering the differences between social capital and social network research (and echoed in other excellent theoretical work; see Erikson, 2013). However, this distinction may not be detailed enough to capture the complexity of the research being conducted in these areas. A more detailed set of categories may enhance understanding of the heterogeneous terrain covered by studies of social capital and social networks. We divide this terrain into four categories that clarify the\dots}

  abstract={International trade can have profound effects on domestic institutions. We examine this proposition in the context of medieval Venice circa 800Ð1600. Early on, the growth of long-distance trade enriched a broad group of mer- chants who used their newfound economic muscle to push for constraints on the executive, that is, for the end of a de facto hereditary Doge in 1032 and the establishment of a parliament in 1172. The merchants also pushed for remark- ably modern innovations in contracting institutions that facilitated long- distance trade, for example, the colleganza. However, starting in 1297, a small group of particularly wealthy merchants blocked political and economic competition: they made parliamentary participation hereditary and erected bar- riers to participation in the most lucrative aspects of long-distance trade. Over the next two centuries this led to a fundamental societal shift away from pol- itical openness, economic competition, and social mobility and toward political closure, extreme inequality, and social stratification. We document this oli- garchization using a unique database on the names of 8,178 parliamentarians and their familiesÕ use of the colleganza in the periods immediately before and after 1297. We then link these families to 6,959 marriages during 1400Ð1599 to document the use of marriage alliances to monopolize the galley trade. Monopolization led to the rise of extreme inequality, with those who were powerful before 1297 emerging as the undisputed winners.}

  abstract={In order to gain an understanding of how elites affect the development process, one of the first challenges is to investigate who are the elites and how do they access positions of power. The characteristics of the hyper-elites network and how it impacts on the distribution of power may constitute a key determining factor of the political equilibrium and the economic trajectory of a country. This article shows first the relevance of data from a first-hand statistical survey designed to be representative of the hyper-elites in Madagascar. This survey managed to capture in a comprehensive manner the pathways and the social networks of ÔelitesÕ. The latter are defined as those who hold or have held top positions and/or have a level of responsibility in nine different spheres of power (political [governmental, elective and partisan], eco- nomic, religious, military, civil society, international organisation and public institution). Our empirical approach focused on social capital, instead of income or wealth, provides an innovative way to apprehend and to study in its entirety and nationwide how ÔÔthe powerful upper tailÓ functions. Drawing on this unique dataset of 1000 hyper-elites, we show to what extent position of power is associated to four key elite network dimensions: size, quality, diversity of contacts and strength of ties. More specifically, the quality and diversity of ties are among the most relevant determinants of access to positions of power. Our analysis sheds light on the hyper-elite strategy of network building to ÔÔkeep themselves to themselvesÓ and on the importance attached to casts and other inherited positions. It explains the limited social mobility and the huge gap between the elites and the majority of the population, which are among the causes of MadagascarÕs recession.}

Governors are more likely to be promoted to higher salaried colonies when connected to their superior during the period of patronage. Once allocated, they provide more tax exemptions, raise less revenue, and invest less. The promotion and performance gaps disappear after the abolition of patronage appointments. Patronage therefore distorts the allocation of public sector positions and reduces the incentives of favored bureaucrats to perform.}

   abstract={''It is not what you know but who you know'' is a popular insight that captures the central hypothesis examined by research in this chapter, that social networks or connections matter for realizing socio-economic outcomes. The concept of social capital was introduced first into economics by Loury (1977) and into sociology and broader social science (Portes, 1998) by Bourdieu (1980, 1986). Other early contributions include Burt (1992), Coleman (1988) and Putnam (1993). 1 This early work drew on three broadly common ideas: social capital is causally related to positive or beneficial outcomes for individuals and groups; it arises from networks or associations between actors; and these associations are founded on common norms, values or shared trust (Durlauf & Fafchamps, 2004). The early literature varies about whether all three elements comprise social capital with Coleman and Putnam, in particular, defining it broadly and Lin more narrowly. For Coleman (1988, 1990), social capital is any resource based in social structure that helps an actor facilitate an objective. For Putnam (1993), social capital is a collective resource arising from interactions between individuals in networks, based on norms of trust and reciprocity that motivate and characterize these interactions (Li, 2015). Both Coleman and Putnam see social capital as a network-based resource, but other elements, such as norms, trust or culture (Putnam, 1993) or a social or economic outcome (Coleman, 1990) must also be present. By bundling network resources and correlates or outcomes of these resources, Coleman and Putnam define social capital in terms of potential causes and effects (Lin, 2001, p. 28). Their definitions assume that collective norms or social and economic outcomes accompany network resources rather than being conceptually distinct and empirically contingent. Combining cause and effect makes causal analysis of social capital effects tautologous (Lin, 2001, p. 29). For this reason we define social capital as Òresources embedded in social structure that are accessed and/or mobilized for purposive actionsÓ(Lin, 2001, p. 29). This definition does not mean that social capital resources are necessarily mobilized, or that their existence or use must realize an outcome. It does mean that network resources can, in principle, be mobilized towards purposeful objectives, but how or if this occurs are theoretical and empirical questions. Lin (2001, p. 43) further distinguishes between personal resources like education, wealth and positional authority that individuals own or directly control, and social resources, that are accessible to actors through their networks and social connections (that is direct and indirect ties to others). Social capital thus refers to social resources embedded in social networks that can be used purposefully and are accessible to individuals via their networks. One stream of social capital research focuses on how network resources are linked to social mobility.
Social mobility is a general term describing individual movement (mobility) through a social structure. Research has concentrated on mobility through socio-economic structures such as education, social class, occupational or job structures, and social hierarchies of socio-economic status, occupational prestige and social standing. Related literatures, which we do not consider in detail, examine social capital effects on labour market outcomes like finding}
